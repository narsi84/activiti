# activiti

Inspired by [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FVS6V9Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) product, I built my own Raspberry Pi based game console so I can create custom games for my kids. The console has a custom built 64-key pad on which key-coded game cards can be loaded. Each game card has a number of items, each of which, when pressed plays an audio clip. Each item can have multiple audio clips and a random clip will be played with the item is pressed. The audio content for each item can be either an uploaded audio file or just a text that is converted to audio using [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/). Both learn and play modes are supported. 

I also made a [web version](https://narsi84.github.io/activiti/) of this game later so it can be played from anywhere.
